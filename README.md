<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

This repository contains a comprehensive ASP.NET Core Web API project showcasing following features of ASP.NET Core with .NET 8.

#### Onion Architecture

<p align="center">
  <img src="Images/onion.png" alt="Onion Architecture Image" />
</p>

Organized using Onion architecture principles to maintain modularity and separation of concerns. ASPNETPlus has separate Domain, Service, Presentation and infrastructure layers. The Outer layers can make use of inner layers but inner layers won't be aware of the outer layers.
[This](https://medium.com/expedia-group-tech/onion-architecture-deed8a554423) is a very good starting point, if you wish to learn more about Onion architecture. 


#### Logging using NLog

<p align="center">
  <img src="Images/NLog.jpg" alt="Onion Architecture Image" />
</p>

[NLog](https://nlog-project.org/documentation/) is a powerful logging framework that provides extensive logging capabilities for ASP.NET Web API applications. With NLog, developers can easily configure and manage logging levels, targets, and formats, allowing for comprehensive monitoring and analysis of application behavior. It offers flexibility in logging to various targets such as files, databases, and cloud services, making it a versatile choice for logging needs in ASP.NET Web API projects.
ASPNETPlus displays detailed setup and configuration of NLog for logging in ASP.NET Core.


#### Filters

ASP.NET filters are attributes that inject logic into the request pipeline, enabling global or selective application of cross-cutting concerns like authorization and validation in ASP.NET applications.


#### Error Handling Best Practices

Exception handling in ASP.Net, conventionally has been dine using middleware. However with .Net 8, a more powerful way of exception handling is : [IExceptionHandler](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.diagnostics.iexceptionhandler?view=aspnetcore-8.0). ASPNETPlus showcases both ways.


#### Content Negotiation

Content Negotiation in ASP.NET Core refers to the process of determining the most suitable content format (JSON, XML, etc.) to send in response to client requests based on the request headers. It allows APIs to provide data in different formats, enhancing interoperability and flexibility for clients consuming the API.
ASPNETPlus showcases content negotiation for JSON, XML, and even custom format.


#### Bulk Creation of Resources

Shows implementation of bulk creation endpoints using [Custom ModelBinder](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/mvc/advanced/custom-model-binding?view=aspnetcore-8.0).


#### Validation

Shows the various ways of request input validation using built-in ASP.NET Core features, including filters.


#### Handling Parent-Child Relations

Shows strategies for handling entities with parent-child relations.


#### HTTP Actions

Shows implementation of standard HTTP actions like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS, HEAD.


#### Advanced Data Handling

Features filtering, paging, searching, sorting, and data shaping to minimize network bandwidth.


#### Rate Limiting and Throttling

Implementation of rate limiting and throttling for API endpoints.


#### Versioning

API versioning to support backward compatibility.


#### Documentation using Swagger

Integration with Swagger for API documentation.
